# TCGA-CNN
A convolutional neural network implementation for predicting gene expression from H&amp;E-stained histology slides.

## Creating a manifest

The manifest is created in the [GDC Data Portal repository](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/repository) by adding the
desired files to the cart and downloading. From there, the manifest is entered into the dataProcessing.py file for
processing to occur. Whole slide images are selected and added to the cart and downloaded.

Cancer Manifest Files:
1. Brain Cancer: gdc_manifest_20230408_201809
2. Breast Cancer: gdc_manifest_20230408_202627
3. Kidney Cancer: gdc_manifest_20230408_203008

## Downloading manifest data

Installing the [gdc install](https://www.debuggingtissue.com/latest-articles/installing-and-using-the-cli-gcd-data-transfer-tool-client-using-an-ubuntu-os)

## Data labeling method

Data presented by TCGA project doesn't include labels conducive to training a neural network in their manifest data.
To circumvent this problem, a python script to scrape web data is implemented. This script scrapes the TCGA whole slide
image database for the appropriate labelâ€”either as primary tumor or as solid tissue normal. The input for this script
is the manifest file produced by the GDC Data Portal.
